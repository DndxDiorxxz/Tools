3. Run the Program
   - Run the compiled file directly with Python:

4. Optional: Decompile or Protect
   - To decompile and view source code:
       pip install uncompyle6
       uncompyle6 multi_tool.pyc > multi_tool.py
   - To protect or obfuscate, use pyarmor:
       pyarmor obfuscate multi_tool.py
